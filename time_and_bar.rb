# There are three parts to this challenge and remember to push your solution.

# PART 1:
# - Create a well named variable that contains the amount of time it took you to get to class
# - Create a complete sentence  that lets us know how you got to class and how long it took
# - Print this complete sentence

# 3 cocktails
# 2 waters
# and
# 6 beers

# Write a program that asks the customer for their order.
#   if they order a cocktail, add one to the number of cocktails you need to make,
#   if they order a water, add one to the number of waters you need to make,
#   if they order a beer, add one to the number of beers you need to pour

# Print the final drinks order so you know what to make
